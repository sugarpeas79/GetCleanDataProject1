==================

There is only one script needed to produce the desired tidy dataset, run_analysis.R. To use this script:

1. Download the raw data folder UCI HAR Dataset and the script run_analysis.R to your working directory
2. Open the R script in R, and run it.
3. The script will export a text file containing the tidy data table called tidy_data.txt to the working directory.
